# CommunityCommands for V Rising
CommunityCommands is a server modification for V Rising that adds chat commands that are compatbible with [VampireCommandFramework](https://github.com/decaprime/VampireCommandFramework). This is a spirtual successor in the line of ChatCommands by Nopey and RPGMods by Kaltharos. This mod is not a direct fork from that line and will not contain the RPG functionalities. It's purpose is to provide a generic collection of commands for a variety of community server needs.

## Commands
- `.bloodpotion`
- `.spawnnpc`
